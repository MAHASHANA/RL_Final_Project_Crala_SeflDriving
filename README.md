# 🚗 Autonomous Navigation in CARLA Using Reinforcement Learning

### 👨‍💻 Project by:
- **Srinivas Peri**  
- **Srimathnath Thejasvi Vondivillu**

---

## 📝 Overview
This project explores the design and training of a **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** agent for autonomous navigation in the **CARLA simulator**. Using a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**, the agent learns to:
- Avoid collisions just using camera feed.
- Adhere to traffic rules and maintain a constant speed of 50 mi/h.


---

## 🌟 Features
- **Simulator**: CARLA (v0.9.15) for realistic urban driving scenarios.
- **Algorithm**: Deep Q-Network (DQN) with Xception-based architecture.
- **Dynamic Rewards**: Encourages safe, efficient, and rule-compliant navigation.

---

## 🔗 Repository Includes:
- Code for training and evaluating the RL agent.
- Preprocessed data and logs.
